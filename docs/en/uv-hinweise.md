# Project management with uv
[Deutsch](../de/uv-hinweise.md) | English

uv is a Python package manager that stands out for its speed and efficiency. It is written in Rust and aims to simplify the management of Python packages and projects.

uv's goal is to provide a comprehensive tool for Python that ties together every part of Python development. It can install Python itself and offers a unified, fast solution for managing dependencies, virtual environments, and Python versions. Typically uv is 10-100x faster than `pip`.

## Core features of uv

uv offers many capabilities that make working with Python projects easier:

* **Install Python versions:** uv can install and manage multiple Python versions.
* **Create virtual environments:** uv creates and manages virtual environments to avoid conflicts between projects.
* **Manage dependencies:** uv tracks project dependencies and produces a lockfile (`uv.lock`) to guarantee reproducible environments.
* **Run scripts:** uv can execute scripts inside an isolated environment.
* **Compatibility with `pip`:** uv provides a `pip`-compatible interface and can replace `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv`.
