# Project Management with uv

uv is a package and project manager for Python. It combines installation, virtual environments, and dependency management in a single tool.

- [uv-project.md](uv-project.md): Step-by-step instructions for setting up a project
- [permission-mac.md](permission-mac.md): Fixing permission issues on macOS

## Notes for Windows

On Windows we recommend using **Git Bash** to install and use uv. Git Bash provides a Unix-like environment that works well with uv.

If Git Bash is not installed yet, you can add it like this:

1. Download **Git for Windows**: [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Run the installer. You can keep the default options and simply click "Next".
3. After the installation you will find a new program called **Git Bash** in the Windows Start menu. Open it.
